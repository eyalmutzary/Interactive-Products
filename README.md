## Welcome to LLM Life Simulation!

This research is about the abillity of LLM to create a simulation. That means, given an initial setting, the LLM reports every hour the latest events occured. 
The questions the research tries to answer are:

### Perception of Reality:
- Understanding Real Life: How well do LLMs comprehend real-world scenarios?
- Generating Logical Events: Are LLMs capable of creating realistic simulations with logical sequences of events?

### Perception of Interest:
- Simulating Interest: What factors contribute to making a simulation engaging from the perspective of an LLM?
- Measuring Interest: Can we quantify what makes a simulation interesting?

## Versions
During the process of the research, I made some versions including with multiple improvements. Since it is a research, I wanted it to contain also the process I've been through.
So these are the versions:
- v1.py : the very first attempt, to generate a setting and run a simulation.
- setting_generator.py : Attempt to focus on the setting generation and use multiple techniques to create the most suitable setting for the simulation.
- simulation_v1.py : First attempt to focus on the simulator. Suffers from wrong time perception, non-logical events and over drama.
- simulation_v2.py : Final attemp to focus on the simulator. Added many features to improve and optimize the simulator mechanism.
